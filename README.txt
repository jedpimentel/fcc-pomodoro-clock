The "design" jpg is included for reference, in case anyone is interested. It was the initial sketch sketch I made, some parts should be striked out as I'm no longer interested in them. I had used an airhorn wav as a placeholder "alarm", but then I started to get fond of it and now I can't fathom removing it. It might startle someone hearing it for the first time though. Maybe an option to switch alarm type might be nice.

I tried to use this workflow:

Step 1: Draw the site and functionality on a sheet of paper.
Step 2: Write as basic HTML as possible. Lines and placeholders, minimal/no CSS
Step 3: Create the functionality/scripting, conecting it the placeholder interface.
Step 4: Clean the JavaScript.
Step 5: Create your fancy interface, replacing the basic HTML version.

I'm uploading to github right before "step 5", since I want to try to not use bootstrap, and the HTML part will take me some time. (plus, I kind of like the current state of the app)

To do:
	a nice UI
	option to switch to another "alarm" wav, for the faint of heart
	not suck at HTML
