The "design" jpg is included for reference, in case anyone is interested. It was the initial sketch I made, some parts should be striked out as I'm no longer interested in them. I had used an airhorn wav as a placeholder "alarm", but then I started to get fond of it and now I can't bear removing it. It might startle someone hearing it for the first time though. Maybe an option to switch alarm type might be nice.

I tried to use this workflow:

Step 1: Draw the site and functionality on a sheet of paper.
Step 2: Write as basic HTML as possible. Lines and placeholders, minimal/no CSS
Step 3: Create the functionality/scripting, conecting it the placeholder interface.
Step 4: Clean the JavaScript.
Step 5: Create your fancy interface, replacing the basic HTML version.

Step 4.1 panic and remove a bunch of stuff because I actually have to do it now

Also, since I'm already working on this, I might as well try the pomodoro technique myself. If I'm making it, I should be testing/using it myself. Maybe it'll help me feel less unproductive... okay I tried it, it actually helps keep me from procrastinating. It felt almost like being in an actual office. 

I didn't want to use Bootstrap, which is why I started with the text-based GUI, to then make an okay GUI. It might not have been a good idea, since a lot of my code became useless during the switch.

To do:
	progress bar
	
Maybe in a perfect future:
	option to switch to another "alarm" wav, for the faint of heart
	option to save "settings" in local storage, between sessions
	option to disable the clicks every second.... or maybe just decrease it's volume.
	not suck at HTML
